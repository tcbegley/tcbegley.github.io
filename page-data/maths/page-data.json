More specifically it turns out that many\\nproblems in geometry are described by differential equations, and often one\\nhopes that by better understanding the behaviour of the equation and its\\nsolutions, one can gain insight into the original geometric problem. This can\\nalso work the other way; often the equations that arise from these geometric\\nproblems are somehow 'typical' examples of a wider class of equations containing\\nthem. One hopes that perhaps insights coming from the geometric picture, could\\nlead to development of techniques that will generalise to the wider class of\\nequations where perhaps there is no obvious associated geometric picture or\\nintuition.\"), mdx(\"h3\", null, \"Publications\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"\\\"On short time existence of Lagrangian mean curvature flow\\\" joint with Kim\\nMoore.
