I studied problems in\ngeometric analysis, an area of maths that brings together ideas from\ndifferential equations, geometry and measure theory. You can find some notes,\npapers and my thesis below after the descriptions of what I worked on.</p>\n<h3>For the mathematicians</h3>\n<p>My work was focussed on geometric variational problems, formulated in the\nlanguages of geometric measure theory and PDE. In particular I was interested in\nthose problems arising from the study of the area functional of submanifolds of\nEuclidean space or, more generally, a Riemannian manifold. I worked on problems\nrelating to mean curvature flow (which is like the gradient descent for area),\nwhere I was mostly interested in the process of singularity formation and the\nexistence and regularity of weak solutions. I was also interested in the\nregularity of stationary varifolds (these are measure theoretic notions of\nminimal submanifolds, and so are critical for area), and in particular worked on\ntrying to understand boundary behaviour, and regularity up to the boundary.</p>\n<h3>For the civilians</h3>\n<p>I worked in an area of mathematics called geometric analysis. Broadly speaking,\nwhat this means is that I worked on problems in geometry (the study of space and\nshapes) using techniques and ideas from analysis (this is a rather large area of\nmathematics that is hard to define well, but relates mostly to calculus and the\nideas that arose from its development). More specifically it turns out that many\nproblems in geometry are described by differential equations, and often one\nhopes that by better understanding the behaviour of the equation and its\nsolutions, one can gain insight into the original geometric problem. This can\nalso work the other way; often the equations that arise from these geometric\nproblems are somehow 'typical' examples of a wider class of equations containing\nthem. One hopes that perhaps insights coming from the geometric picture, could\nlead to development of techniques that will generalise to the wider class of\nequations where perhaps there is no obvious associated geometric picture or\nintuition.</p>\n<h3>Publications</h3>\n<p>\"On short time existence of Lagrangian mean curvature flow\" joint with Kim\nMoore.
